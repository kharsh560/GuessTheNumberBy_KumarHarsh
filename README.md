# GuessTheNumberBy_KumarHarsh
I have made this project as a part of my journey to learn inDepth Java Script! Its a simple game of guessing the number. I learnt about many new events and sophisticated methods to deal with the elements in the DOM! Was fun by the way. This project is a part of vid_35 of the playlist Chai aur JavaScript by Hitesh Choudhary.
